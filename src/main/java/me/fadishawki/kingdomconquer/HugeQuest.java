 * Welcome to Kingdom Conquer,
 *
 * In this algorithm challenge you will need to conquer all kingdoms by
 * creating an efficient algorithm that generates the most cost-effective
 * route to conquer all kingdoms.
 *
 * Explanation:
 * - You will start at a kingdom.
 * - Entering a new kingdom, or travelling a road to a new kingdom will cost gold.
 * - When a kingdom is conquered all its adjacent kingdoms will also be conquered.
 * - When all kingdoms are conquered you will return to the starting kingdom.
